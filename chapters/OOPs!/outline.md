OOPs! _ Object Orient Programming, OOP: a practical approach in OF
=========

notes:
- trying to not be redundant with Josh's Chapter, this would be a direct approach / practical example to OOP in OF
- this will be loosely based on and extended from the OOPs tutorial
http://www.openframeworks.cc/tutorials/first%20steps/003_ooops_object_oriented_programming.html

- brief notes about OOP:
	- what is OOP
		- Objects and Classes 
		- example of basic class and object
			- make a very simple class with setup, update and draw methods (simple particle ?)
			- make your object from the class
			- make multiple objects the hard way
			- make an array of objects (the easy way) _ using a CONSTANT
			- make an array of objects (the easy way) _ array using pointers
			- make an array of objects (the easy way) _ dynamic size of array using stl::vector
			- make an array of objects (the easy way) _ dynamic size of array using stl::vector and destroying objects if they leave the screen
	
	- more OOPs! : Polymorphism
		-What is it / what does it mean ?
		- example of basic class and object (polymorphism)
			- make a simple class (simple particle?)
			- make different objects from the same class
