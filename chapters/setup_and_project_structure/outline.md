#WELCOME TO THE KITCHEN#
##h and cpp files, some OOP and the IDE##

I've have had some success explaining this things to my students by making a direct analogy with cooking and a kitchen. Everyone has experienced it so it is an easy way to make them feel comfortable and be able to understand these things
###the kitchen:###
####IDE:####
- What is it for.
- Different brands, almost the same thing.
- Intro to xCode, VS, C::B, Â¿maybe Eclipse?
	- The main goal here would be to establish the similarities between all IDEs and explain where are the fundamental options needed to compile and solve common errors (missing include paths, linker errors).
	- Adding files to the IDE, in particular adding addons (should we mention, as a sidenote Adam's xCode OF plugin?). How it must be done in each IDE.

- The NO-IDE IDE. Using the terminal and makefiles.
	- Possible scenarios where this is useful (rPI, remote compiling via SSH)
	- How to deal with it. Installing the needed stuff to make it work (make, etc)
	- How to use OF's make files. 
	- Using addons

####The OF Pantry:####

- What stuff is in here.
- Its usefulness. 
- How it is arranged/ordered.
- How to use it. Probably mention al the available "things", link to another chapter where some explanation of use is available. Add some explanation for the ones that are not covered anywhere else in the book.

###The recipes; .h and .cpp files:###
- Make a straight analogy between these files and recipes, the bill of materials, needed tools and instructions-steps.
- Why 2 files instead of just one.
- How these files are structured (in OF)
- Peeking at others files, OF's files in search for some help.
- Some basic OOP, related to the idea of making a lot of the same recipe, how to deal with it. Link to the other chapters where OOP is covered.
