#Hardware

*by [Caitlin Morris](http://www.caitlinmorris.net/) and [Pierre Proske](http://www.digitalstar.net/)*


## introduction

This chapter will give you an introduction to working with openFrameworks outside of your computer screen and into the physical world. Why exactly would you want to do this? Well, given that we are physical creatures ourselves, having software control, sense and actuate real-world things can be pretty exciting and create truly visceral experiences. Screen based work can be captivating, but physical installations have the potential to deliver greater impact due to their more tangible nature.

There are a number of ways of taking your openFrameworks app out of the frame of your own personal computer and getting it to interact with the outside world. Largely this involves some kind of communication from openFrameworks to whatever hardware you've decided to hook up to. The different types of computer based communications (or protocols) vary, but the most common is what's known as 'serial' communication, so called because each bit of data sent is transferred one after the other (as opposed to multiple bits being sent in parallel). 

The first hardware that we'll look at interfacing with is the excellent **Arduino** prototyping platform.  Arduino is, in its own words, an *"open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and softwareâ€¦ intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.*"  It's easy to see why there's a lot of overlap between communities of people interested in using openFrameworks and Arduino!  With Arduino, it's quick to get your openFrameworks app hooked up to sensors (like light sensors, proximity sensors, or other methods of environmental input), actuators (like lights, motors, and other outputs), and real-time interaction.  You're free to move out of the realm of pixels and into the physical world.

This chapter assumes that you have the Arduino IDE installed, in addition to the environment that you normally use for working with openFrameworks.  If not, you can download it from the Arduino website (arduino.cc) or the Arduino github (github.com/arduino).

Additionally, following along with the examples in this chapter requires you to have a few pieces of basic hardware.  You'll need an Arduino (any generation; an Uno, Leonardo, or Duemilanove will look the most like the graphics in this chapter but any USB-connected Arduino will work just fine) and the appropriate USB cable to connect to your computer.  

[** Callout - The Leonardo differs from earlier boards in that it has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary processor. This allows the Leonardo to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual serial port. This makes setting up interactive applications a very simple procedure - in your openFrameworks app all you need to do is check for a key press! **]

## getting started with serial communication


**SERIAL: ONE AFTER THE OTHER**

Serial, in the most basic language sense, refers to things that come one after another; it's a term often used to describe magazines, crimes, and television programs.  That meaning also applies when talking about serial data:  "serial communication" means that all information between two entities is being sent one piece at a time, following in a single stream.  One piece of data, or one bit, is just a binary piece of information: you're either sending a 0 or a 1.  Using the terminology of digital electronics, these are frequently referred to as "high" and "low"; 0 is low (like turning a light off) and 1 is high (flipping it back on).  8 bits (for example the stream 01000001, which represents the letter A) are sometimes packaged together to create a single byte.

Serial communication is actually a very broad topic and there are many serial protocols, including audio-visual protocols such as DMX (based on RS-485) and MIDI (serial at 31,250 bits per second) which we'll briefly cover in this chapter. The most common serial protocol is called RS-232 and computers used to be equipped with RS-232 serial ports (remember them?) but today they are rarely present, which is why serial communications involving a computer will typically require an RS-232 to USB adaptor (found on-line or at your local electronics store).

![RS-232 to USB adaptor](images/USB-rs232.jpg "RS-232 to USB adaptor")

However, if you're connecting to an Arduino, it already appears to the computer as a virtual serial port and you just need a regular USB cable (the exact type is dependent on which model Arduino you have). The Arduino also has a built-in library which handles reading and writing to the serial port that appears on your computer. Additionally, the Arduino has bi-directional RS-232 serial ports which can be used to connect to other external serial devices. In short - the Arduino is well equipped for serial communications and does most of the hard work for you!

 **note: expand on Serial library**
 

The speed at which data is transmitted between the Arduino and your software is measured in bits per second, or bps, a fairly self-explanatory unit of measurement.  The rate of bits per second is commonly referred to as the baud rate, and will vary based on your application.  For example, the standard baud rate of 9600bps will transfer data more slowly than a rate of 115200, but the faster baud rate may have more issues with byte scrambling.

```
-- editor joshuajnoble I think adding some explanation of what rs232 is (a picture of an oscilloscope would be good) the flow of using:

enumerateDevices()
setup()
available()
close()

So you can find all serial devices, open the device, check if it has data, close the port and release the file handle.

Might be nice to have the Arduino serial example mirror the DMX example, like:


here's some Arduino code to kick this off

int redPin   = 9;   // Red LED
int greenPin = 10;  // Green LED
int bluePin  = 11;  // Blue LED

int color[4];
long int inByte; 
int wait = 10; //10ms

void setup()
{
  pinMode(redPin,   OUTPUT);   // sets the pins as output
  pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT);   
  pinMode(bluePin,  OUTPUT);
  
  Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void outputColour(int red, int green, int blue) {
  analogWrite(redPin, red);
  analogWrite(bluePin, blue);
  analogWrite(greenPin, green);    
}

void setColor() {
  int i = 0;
  
  //wait and be patient
  while (i < 4)
  {
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {
        color[i] = Serial.read();
        i++;
    }
  }
}

// Main program
void loop()
{
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    // get incoming byte:
    inByte = Serial.read();
    
     if (inByte == 'C') {
      getColour();
      analogWrite(redPin, color[1]);
      analogWrite(bluePin, color[2]);
      analogWrite(greenPin, color[3]); 
    } 
  }
  delay(wait);
}

-- end editor
```

## digital and analog communication

**USING SERIAL MONITOR WITH ARDUINO**

The Arduino IDE has a built-in Serial monitor, which enables you to "tune in" to the data coming across a serial port at a specified baud rate.  You can find the Serial Monitor either under Tools - Serial Monitor in the Arduino menu bar, or in the "magnifying glass" icon at the top of the IDE.

In the Arduino sketch, set up Serial communication and print a basic "Hello world!" phrase to the Serial monitor in the setup() function:

```cpp
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println("Hello world!");

```
Open the Serial monitor and make sure that your monitor is set to the same baud rate as your sketch (the variable that you set in Serial.begin() ). Note that the TX/RX lights on your Arduino flash once on setup - you can press the reset button on your Arduino (on most devices) to run setup again to see this more clearly.  The Arduino itself is sending the printed text over Serial and the Serial Monitor is picking up that text and printing it for us to read.

Of course, you can also use the Serial monitor to reflect more interesting data coming from devices that are connected to your Arduino.  You can print both digital and analog input data to Serial.

Digital inputs like pushbuttons, or a switch that only has open and closed positions, will send a binary value as their status.  You can walk through an example of connecting a pushbutton to your Arduino in the excellent Arduino tutorial found here:

http://arduino.cc/en/tutorial/button

To print the value of the pushbutton to Serial, store the returned value from digitalRead in a variable and print that variable to Serial, just as done previously with the "hello world!" example.  Here, though, print in the loop() function rather than setup() so that the value updates continuously rather than only once on reset.

```cpp
buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
Serial.println( buttonState );
```

If you're feeling limited by the binary nature of the pushbutton, you can also read from an analog input, using a component like a potentiometer, photoresistor, or any of the wide variety of sensors that provide non-binary input.

Analog inputs can only be connected on pins A0-A5 on a standard Arduino.  These analog-specific pins have an ADC (analog-digital converter) chip which enables them to convert the amount of voltage returning from the circuit into a digital-readable number between 0 and 1023.

There are a number of examples and tutorials for working with analog input; a basic one using a potentiometer can be found here:

http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput

Printing the incoming variables to the Serial monitor is the same as with a digital input, except that you'll be using the Arduino function for analogRead() rather than digitalRead():

```cpp
sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
Serial.println( sensorValue );
```



## using serial for communication between arduino and openframeworks

In the same way that Arduino uses Serial communication for communication between hardware and the Serial monitor, it can also use Serial communication to communicate between the Arduino board and any other running application, including openFrameworks.  This can be done quite simply using the ofSerial class, native to openFrameworks.  This class sets up a Serial listener at a specified baud rate and Serial port, giving it access to the same streaming data as the Serial library in the native Arduino IDE.  

There's a good, heavily commented demonstration of this in the communications folder of examples that comes bundled with openFrameworks.  The basic components needed to get this working are a Serial object, a toggle for knowing whether a message has been sent or not, and an array for storing the data that we receive.


**USING FIRMATA AS A SERIAL PROTOCOL**

Though it's possible to navigate all serial communication manually, you'll reach the limitations of what you're able to do fairly quickly - as soon as you start wanting to address different devices or have multiple inputs, you'll fall into a spiral of packet management and be much more prone to getting corrupt packets or inaccurate and scrambled data.  Rather than deal with this manually, it's much simpler to use Firmata, an open source protocol for managing multiple Serial streams.

**OFARDUINO**

ofArduino, the built-in Arduino communication class for openFrameworks, is based on Firmata protocol.  Using ofArduino assumes that a default Firmata sketch is loaded onto the Arduino.  This sketch, found in the Arduino examples folder, enables all of the pins of the Arduino for communication through both analog and digital communication, as well as more specific addressing of pins for servomotor control.  

**EXAMPLE**: Work through the same LED blink sketch as done previously with only Arduino, but with OF.


The basic flow of what we're going to do looks like this: (graphic missing)

* Make an ofArduino object
* Connect to the Arduino object at the correct port and baud rate
* Set up an event listener to determine whether we're successfully connected to the Arduino
* Set up a pin to communicate with, and specify whether that communication is analog or digital
* Poll for data from the serial port
* Send HIGH and LOW (or analog value) arguments to that pin

**Make an ofArduino object**

The first step is to add an ofArduino object into the header file of your project (usually, testApp.h).  I'll call this myArduino.

```cpp
void setup();
void update();
void draw();

ofArduino myArduino;
```

Now we've extended the capabilities of the native openFrameworks ofArduino class into our sketch, and we can work with the object myArduino.

**Connect to the Arduino object at the correct port and baud rate**

In the setup() of testApp.cpp, use the ofArduino `connect()` function to set up a connection at the appropriate port and baud rate.  `connect()` takes two parameters: the first is a String of the serial port name, which should match the serial port name you connected to in the Arduino application; the second is the baud rate.  Firmata uses a standard baud rate of 57600 bps.

```cpp
ard.connect("/dev/tty.usbserial-a700fiyD", 57600);
```

**Set up an event listener to determine whether we've successfully connected to the Arduino**

If you're working only within the Arduino IDE, it's easy to have functions (like setting up the pin modes) called only once at the start of the program -- you can just call those functions from within `setup()` with the confidence that they'll always be run once when the device initializes.   When you're communicating with other software like openFrameworks, however, it's important to have a checking system to ensure that any setup functions only occur after a connection has been established.  openFrameworks uses the ofEventUtils class to make this easier, relying on the default `ofAddListener()` and `ofRemoveListener()` functions to check for the connection event.

Within the openFrameworks app, we'll want to create an Arduino-specific `setup()` function, which is only called once as a result of the serial connection being established.  We'll declare this function first in testApp.h:

```cpp
void setupArduino(const int & version);
```

... and call it from testApp.cpp:

```cpp
void testApp::setupArduino(const int & version) {
    // Arduino setup tasks will go here
}
```

The argument that's being passed to the function, `const int & version`, is a default return from the listener we're about to set up, which always responds to a connection event by sending back an argument with the connected firmware version.  That can stay as it is.

In the `setup()` of testApp.cpp, create a listener using `ofAddListener()`.  `ofAddListener()` is a function of ofEventUtils, which takes the arguments (event object, callback object, callback function).  When the event object happens (in this case, when the ofArduino EInitialized event is triggered), ofAddListener tells the callback object (here, a pointer to the testApp itself, referred to as "this") to perform the setupArduino function that we created in the last step.

```cpp
ofAddListener(myArduino.EInitialized, this, &testApp.setupArduino);
```

When the EInitialized event is triggered (when the connection to the Arduino is complete, and the Arduino responds by sending back information about its firmware version), the listener sends us to the callback function, which in this case is `setupArduino()`.

Within `setupArduino()`, we can remove the listener, because we know a connection has been established.  `ofRemoveListener()` takes the same arguments as its counterpart.

```cpp
ofRemoveListener(myArduino.EInitialized, this, &testApp.setupArduino);
```

**Set up a pin to communicate with, and specify whether that communication is analog or digital**

Now it's time to treat our Arduino setup function just like we would within a standard Arduino app, and set up our pins and pin modes.  Here, I'm going to set up my Arduino Pin 13 as a digital output, in preparation for making a basic LED blink.

```cpp
myArduino.sendDigitalPinMode(13, ARD_OUTPUT);
```

The other options for pin setup follow in line with standard Arduino pin settings:

```cpp
sendDigitalPinMode(PIN_NUMBER, ARD_INPUT) // digital input
sendAnalogPinMode(PIN_NUMBER, ARD_OUTPUT) // analog output
sendAnalogPinMode(PIN_NUMBER, ARD_INPUT) // analog input
```

**Poll for data from the serial port**

In order to continuously update with new information on the serial port, it's important to periodically call the ofArduino `update()` function.  This can be done in its own Arduino-specific function, or can be called directly from `testApp::update()`:

```cpp
myArduino.update();
```

That's it! Now you're ready to start sending digital signals to pin 13 on your Arduino. 

There are any number of triggers that you can use to control this signalling: you could set up a timer, integrate it into a game event, use a camera input... the possibilities are endless!  Here, I'm going to trigger my Pin 13 LED to turn on and off based on the up and down arrow keys.

Because I'm controlling activity with keyboard keys, I'm going to use the `void testApp::keyPressed (int key)` function, but you could also place your triggers within `draw()` or another function depending on your desired effect.

```cpp
void testApp::keyPressed  (int key){
    switch (key) {
        case OF_KEY_UP:
   	         	ard.sendDigital(13, ARD_HIGH);  // turn LED on
   	         	break;
			case OF_KEY_DOWN:
				ard.sendDigital(13, ARD_LOW); // turn LED off
				break;
       		default:
           		break;
    	}
	}
```
	
When all the parts are together, run the app and toggle your UP and DOWN arrow keys to turn the on-board LED on your Arduino on and off!  You can also put in a 3mm or 5mm LED on pin 13 to make the effect more obvious.  Remember that pin 13 is the only Arduino pin with a built-in resistor, so if you want to add LEDs or other components on other pins, you'll need to build a full circuit with resistors to avoid burning out your parts.

 
## Lights On - controlling hardware via DMX

DMX (which stands for Digital Multiplex), also known as DMX512 (512 being the number of channels each output can accommodate), is a protocol for controlling lighting and stage equipment. It's been around since the 80's, and is sometimes referred to as the MIDI of the lighting world as it achieves a fairly similar outcome - the sequencing and controlling of hardware through the use of a computer. DMX can be used to control anything from strobes to RGB par-can lights to LED fixtures. It's even possible to drive LED strips by Pulse Width Modulation if you have the right hardware. The advantage of sending DMX through a custom openFrameworks app is that you can then integrate it via all the other goodness OF has to offer, including custom GUI's, custom sequencing algorithms, camera tracking - you name it.

![DMX Lighting](images/stutterspot.jpg "DMX Lighting")

**Overview of the DMX protocol**

In order to send DMX first of all you need a DMX to USB control interface. This is a special box that you'll need to purchase in order to enable your computer to send DMX data via a USB port. These interfaces can be easily purchased on-line in case you can't track one down locally. You'll also need some DMX cables to connect between the interface and the DMX device you want to control. Microphone cables with XLR connectors can be used to send DMX data, although the official standard for DMX is a 5-pin cable, unlike the 3-pins that XLR has to offer. There does exist adaptors between 5 and 3-pin connectors in case you need to mix and match them. In any case, hook up your hardware via cables to your DMX to USB device, install your drivers if required (Operating System dependent) and you are ready to send. As previously mentioned, each DMX output from your controller can send up to 512 channels of DMX data. In DMX terminology, each group of 512 channels is known as a "Universe". Multiple DMX Universes are often used in complex setups requiring lots of channels. Typically you won't need more than a single universe as a single coloured light will only use up around 3 channels (one each for red, green and blue).

**DMX data format**

A DMX packet, in other words the data sent to the hardware each frame, consists of 512 channels, with an 8-bit value sent per channels (i.e. 0-255). One of the idiosyncracies of DMX is that the channel numbering starts at 1, channel 0 being a start code and not a data channel. This means that when setting up an array to hold your per-frame DMX data, you'll need to make it a size of 513 bytes. In openFrameworks we almost always represent a byte as an unsigned char, though you can also represent this with other types.

```cpp
//setup the data structure
unsigned char dmxData[513];

// zero the first value
dmxData[0] = 0;

// channels are valid from here on up
dmxData[1] = 126;
```

A number of OF addons have sprung up around DMX, a quick search of ofxAddons.com will reveal the most up to date. Typically these addons will have set up all the necessary data structures, including the one above, so you won't need to worry about anything other than sending the right data to the right channels. The hardest part will probably be installing the drivers for your controller!

**Structure of an OF DMX application**

No matter which code or which addon you use, the way in which you'll send DMX data will be very similar to the following pseudo-code (replace the comments with the relevant code):

```cpp
void ofApp::setup() {
    //connect to your DMX controller
}

void ofApp::update() {

    //assign the relevant values to your DMX data structure
    
    //update the DMX controller with the new data
}

```
The only concern then becomes what colour you'll be setting your lights and how you'd like to dim them.

**Using a colour picker to set up your lights**

> editor -- see above, I think could be cool to mirror this with the ofSerial example

*TODO*

> editor joshuajnoble I really feel like we should have rpi in its own chapter. It's so tricky to get setup. I do think that talking about something like wiringPi in the context of hardware is a really good idea though, for sure.

##Raspberry Pi - getting your OF app into small spaces##
The Raspberry Pi is a popular small sized computer (also known as a single board computer) running on hardware not entirely dissimilar to that which powers today's smartphones. The processor at least, is part of the same ARM family of chips. Originally the Raspberry Pi (abbreviated as RPi) was originally developed as an educational platform to be able to teach the basics of computing hardware in a simple and affordable package. The Raspberry Pi is part of a much larger ecosystem of ARM devices, and the Model B Pi, the most popular version available shortly after launch, is technically classified as an ARM6 device. OpenFrameworks currently supports ARM6 and ARM7 devices, of which the latter are typically more recent and faster hardware designs. While there are plenty of small form-factor alternatives to the Pi, it's a good choice as a computing platform  due to the community that's formed around it and the various hardware and software extensions that have been developed for it.  The Raspberry Pi is also completely open source, including the source code for the Broadcom graphics stack that it contains, which is quite unusual in the hardware world. The advantages of this are again that it enables enthusiasts and professionals from within the RPi community to extend this device to its fullest potential. Having a platform that is well tested and can be used in many different applications is also of benefit, particularly for installations that need to run for extensive periods of time. However, as with any technology, there are advantages and there are caveats, which we'll cover here, along with some practical scenarios which might be useful to anyone interested in taking this mini-computer into the wilds.

**Setting up a Raspberry Pi**

The Raspberry Pi is typically loaded with a version of the Linux operating system that has been tailored for its particular hardware requirements. The most common is the Raspbian distribution (recommended by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the organisation producing the device) however whichever distribution you choose you'll end up having to engage with the intricacies of Linux at some point, and becoming familiar with using the command-line will be necessary. However fear not, you won't need to dig too deep and most likely you'll just be following well documented guides that others have set up - one of the aforementioned benefits of using this gadget. Having approximately the surface area of an Arduino Mega (although having a slightly higher profile), while far slower than a desktop computer, the RPi is a relatively powerful device with out-of-the-box features (USB 1.1 hub, full networking stack, HDMI and audio out etc.)  than you won't see on an Arduino yet similarly priced. More importantly, within the context of this chapter, the RPi is both small and has a serial port, which lends itself to well to hardware applications where  often both of those are prerequisites.
There's not much point in describing the full setup process of a Raspberry Pi as it's better described elsewhere. The following links will help you get started:

[Raspberry Pi quick start](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/quick-start-guide/)

[OpenFrameworks Raspberry Pi setup](http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup/RPI)


**Raspberry Pi and Serial Ports**

There are multiple ways to set up a serial connection on the RPi. The first method requires a USB to serial cable and involves a virtual serial communication port. If you plug in your USB to serial cable, it should automatically create a software serial port . The naming and location of virtual serial ports on the Raspberry Pi is similar to what you'd find on any stardard Linux operating system.  It's also not unlike the setup found on OSX, which has a unix-like foundation. If you're coming from Windows however, it's a little different to the system of COM ports (COM1, COM2 etc) used there. 

Assuming you've successfully installed your RPi, if you've booted into the graphical environment, then open up a terminal window (double click the LXTerminal icon on the desktop if you're using Raspbian). Otherwise you'll already be on the command-line. Either way, type the following command:

```bash
ls -la /dev/ttyUSB*
```

This should list all of the serial devices on your system, starting from ttyUSB0 and counting upwards. If you see such a device, your USB serial cable has been installed correctly. Plugging in an Arduino to a Raspberry Pi will also create such a serial device, so if you're heading down that path this is where you should look to confirm it is connected. The next thing you should check before moving on however is check what permissions the serial port has.  The Linux file system, much like OSX under the hood, uses the concept of an "owner" of a file and what "group" it belongs to. If you are a member of a file group, you'll be able to access that file even if you are not its owner. File permissions are there for security reasons, which is a good thing, but sometimes they'll trip you up. 
The above command should return with something like this:

```bash
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 Apr  6 23:03 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

In order to be able to read and write to this device normally, you'll need to be a member of group it belongs to, in this case, the "dialout" group.

To check which groups you belong to, type in the following command:

```bash
groups
```

This will return something like:

```bash
adm dialout cdrom sudo dip video plugdev lpadmin sambashare
```

The only thing of note here is to make sure that the group assigned to the serial port (in this case "dialout") is in your groups list. Typically the default "pi" user wil be a member of this group. If it isn't, just run the following command to add it, appending your user login name at the end:

```bash
usermod -a -G dialout yourusername
```

Now you should be able to connect to other serial devices using your cable.


**Raspberry Pi and GPIO**

The RPi has a hardware serial port as well, literally two of the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins on the board are dedicated to hardware based serial transmit and receive. They are listed as pins 8 and 10 or GPIO14 and GPIO15 in the documentation. Don't get confused by the two different names, one is relative to all the pins (8 and 10) and the other is relative to the usable programmable pins (GPIO14 and GPIO15). You might be inclined to use these if you've already used up the Pi's USB ports, or you might want to use them to interface directly with electronics. A word of caution however to anyone connecting any voltages directly to the GPIO pins - there's no protection here against wrong or incorrect voltages. It's nothing to be alarmed about, you're just going to be interfacing directly with the board and the advantages this opens up also exposes you to potentially damaging the board if you do something wrong. Always check your connections and voltages before hooking things up, its a good habit to get into and will avoid frying things. Although truth be told, the only real way to learn is to make mistakes, and there's nothing that'll imprint your memory more effectively than the smell of burning silicon, but I digress...

Another thing to keep in mind when using the hardware serial port is that all of the GPIO pins operate at around 3 volts. This means that a logic "high" will be approximately 3 volts, which differs from the more typical 5 volts used by most (but not all) Arduino devices. There are quite a few sensors and other electronics that operate at 3 volts, and a quick web search will point you in the right direction. This lower than normal voltage is quite useful in low power electronic setups, where the slightly lower voltage will save you a bit of energy, useful when running off batteries. However again be careful when hooking up 3 volt based sensors directly to the Pi as it may be safer to include a bit of protection between the electronics and the Pi to avoid damaging the board. 

In order to compensate for the difference in voltage between a regular 5V Arduino and the Pi, you'll need a logic level converter between the two. A quick web search should turn up a converter that'll suit your needs, all you need to then do is hook the two devices up to the converter, with the Pi connecting to the 3V side of the converter and the Arduino hooked up to the 5V side. Remember to always make sure that the serial transmit (or TX for short) from one board is connected to the serial receive (or RX for short) on the other. You'll need power and ground supplied from both sides too. Once this is done, you're ready to start communicating between the two. All the openFrameworks procedures of communicating between an Arduino and OF, detailed above, now apply. As a fail-safe test of whether the serial port is set up correctly, you can always do a test on the Pi side by using the venerable minicom command-line application. It's a text only interface to the serial port, useful for quick low-level serial debugging. It might feel a little archaic initially, but it does its job and it's very lightweight. 

To install minicom, just open a terminal window and type the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install minicom
```

You can then send characters to the Arduino via Minicom, and view them using the serial monitor on the Arduino. Make sure both devices have the same baud rate. Launch minicom using the following command (if operating at 9600 baud):

```bash
minicom -b 9600 -o -D /dev/ttyAMA0
```

where the number 9600 represents the baud rate and /dev/ttyAMA0 is the address of our GPIO serial port.
What you type into the minicom terminal screen should appear on the Arduino serial monitor and vice versa.


**Case Study: Raspberry PI as a master DMX controller**

One of the nifty uses of a Raspberry Pi is to use it as a master DMX controller. It takes up little space and sending serial data doesn't require much processing power so it's a perfect candidate. Add to that the ability to control your OF app running on the PI remotely via OSC, for example using an Android or IOS tablet, and you have a fully fledged custom DMX set up which would otherwise require expensive commercial software to replicate.

**Headless Apps**

Given that the Raspberry Pi can be viewed as a Swiss-army knife in the installation world and has less processing power than a desktop computer, you may often find yourself using it for a specific task and that task may not require any graphical output (like churning out DMX commands for example). In this case, you can disable the graphical capabilities of openFrameworks in order to streamline your application for the task at hand. Using an application in this fashion is know as running the application "headless". In order to build a headless application (which works for all target platforms, not just the RPi), all you'll need to do is open up your project's main.cpp and change it to the following:

```cpp
//ofSetupOpenGL(1024,768, OF_WINDOW);            // <-------- comment out the setup of the GL context

// this kicks off the running of my headless app:
ofRunApp( new ofAppNoWindow());
```

Voila! Your application will now run without opening a graphical window. This can be particularly useful when launch it from a script or the command-line, as well see shortly.


**Running your app on start-up**

So, you've created an OF app that does some amazing stuff, and chances are you've turned to this little over-achieving box because of it's size and now you want to incorporate it into an installation. Ideally, technical installations, whether interactive or not, should be super easy to set up and turn on, in order to place little demands on gallery or event staff that might be minding the piece, and to reduce the chances of something going wrong. Ideally, you'll turn the power of the Pi on, and once it has booted up your app will run. Additionally, if your app doesn't make use of any graphics or visual output, you might want to run it in what's called "headless" mode, where the graphical capabilities of OF are turned off. This will save power and reduce processor demand on the Pi.

Running an application on start up can be done in many different ways on a Linux based system such as the Pi. However here are a couple of methods that you could use depending on your needs.
Firstly, there's a file called "rc.local" in amongst the Pi's system files where you can list applications that'll be run on start up. In order to make use of this you'll need to have the Pi booting into the command line. If the Pi is running the GUI, this won't work. To configure your Pi to start up in command-line mode, run the So to make use of this method, open up a terminal and do the following:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

This will open up this file using the command-line text editor "nano" and because it is a system file you'll need to use the "sudo" (short for Super User Do ....i.e. do something as if you were the super user, a user with permission to modify system files) command to give you access to an otherwise protected file. Once you've opened this file, after the initial comments (lines beginning with '#') add the following lines (replacing "myProject" with the name of your app):

```bash
# Auto run our application
/home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/myProject/bin/myProject &
```

Add these lines and then hit CTRL-X to save (hit 'Y to confirm that you want to overwrite the current file). The ampersand indicates thatThen if all has gone well, next time you reboot your application will launch. You won't have any window decorations (such as a border and buttons for minimise and close), but if you run the application full-screen that won't matter anyway, and you have the advantage of not running a GUI environment which eats up resources on the otherwise busy Pi.


The other way to run applications is to use the "cron" system.  Cron, if enabled (which it normally will be by default on a Pi), is a daemon (or persistent application that runs in the background) is a piece of software whose only purpose is to carry out actions at particular times of the day. Essentially it's a scheduler, much like a calendar reminder system except instead of reminders you'll be scheduling various tasks. All you need to do then will be to tell Cron to run your app whenever the system boots up. All cron actions are stored in special files which exist on the Pi in the /var/spool/cron/contab/ directory. You aren't allowed to edit these files directly, you need to run a special application called *crontab* which you can then use to create and modify those files.

In the case of starting our app on boot, all we need to do then is type the following in a terminal (replace 'pi' with your username if not logged in with the default account):

```bash
sudo crontab -e -u pi
```
    
Then a file will open up and you can edit it in the same way as you would using nano (if fact *crontab* is making use of *nano* in this process). Just add the following line to the file:

```bash
@reboot  /home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/myExampleApp &
```

Substitute the right app and and the right folder names depending on where your OF app is located. You'll need to get the full path right, so make sure it's correct before hitting CTRL-X to save the file.
Once saved, again all you'll need to do is reboot to witness your app being kicked off on start-up. Presto!

In either case above, if you wanted to make sure that your app restarted upon crashing, you could wrap the application in a shell script running a while loop, such as this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/app/myApps/myExampleApp/bin
while true; do
    ./myExampleApp
done
```

All you would need to do would be to copy the above code into a file and save it as something like "myApp.sh". Then make it executable by changing the file's permissions:

```bash
chmod a+x myApp.sh
```

To test the shell script, just try running it in a terminal window by typing "./myApp.sh" in the same directory as the script. If it launches successfully, you can then replace any direct references to the app in the above auto-start examples with this script. Keep in mind, the only way to fully kill the app will be to kill the process running this shell script with a command such as

```bash
kill -9 1234

```
where you need to replace '1234' with the process id (PID) of your script. The PID can be found by typing 

```bash
ps -A
```
   
in a terminal. This will list all running processes on the system. Anyhow, that's enough system administration for the moment, time to get creative instead.
